!2 Common parts

The attribute type describes the type of the presentation. The type is one of three options: pVar, pGroup or container

!4 id
A unique id that the element can be referenced by.

!3 pVar
pVar is a presentation variable that is used to present data for a variable

!4 presentationOf
presentationOf is a reference to the variable that the pVar is presenting.

!4 
!4 mode
The mode describes if the variable should be presented as an output variable (just text) or an input variable (the user is able to enter data).

!2 pGroup
pGroup is a presentation group that is used to present a group of variables (or other groups). The presentation group can also contain references to texts that can be used as, for example, a headline.

!4 presentationOf
presentationOf is a reference to the group that the pGroup is presenting.

!4 children
Children is a list of references to the child presentations of the group. Each child needs it own presentation.

!4 
!4 ref
Ref is a reference to another presentation: a pVar, another pGroup or a container. The ref points to the id of the other presentation.

!4 
!4 refMinimized
!-RefMinimized-! is a reference to a presentation that is a minimized version of the usual presentation. The refMinimized points to the id of the other presentation.

!4 
!4 default
Default can be either ref or refMinimized, and points out which of the presentations is the default one.

!2 Container
Container is used to group variables or groups together in a presentation. It might, for example, be repeatable variables that we want to present as a group with a headline, or a variable that we want to present with a leading text.

A container can be one of two types: repeating or surrounding.

!3 Common parts
!4 repeat
Repeat describes whether this is a repeating container(type:this), or a surrounding container (repeat:children)

!4 children
Children is a list of references to the child presentations of the container. Each child needs it own presentation.

!4 ref
Ref is a reference to another presentation: a pVar, another pGroup or a container. The ref points to the id of the other presentation.

!4 refMinimized
!-RefMinimized-!  is a reference to a presentation that is a minimized version of the  usual presentation. The refMinimized points to the id of the other  presentation.

!4 default
Default can be either ref or refMinimized, and points out which of the presentations is the default one.

!3 Repeating container
I a container contains children that are repeated, a repeating container repeats all of the content in the container for as many times as the element that is presented is repeated, so the whole container is repeated. In the example below the container includes a headline and a reference to a group. If the group is repeated, the headline will be repeated once for every time the group is repeated.

!3 Surrounding container
If the container contains children that are repeated, a surrounding container repeats only those children, not the whole container.
